Meeting Notes:
--------------

### 1) I2RS and TE Topology Identifiers

 Reference: [pull request #10](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/pull/10)  

The DT will adopt the updated proposal as working assumption and JSON code be updated accordingly, with two new open issues that, when closed, may require to udpate the conventions and the JSON codes: 

**[Open issue #41](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/issues/41) - Need to register a URN/URI schema to be used with I2RS topology identifiers**
**[Open Issue #42](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/issues/42) - Link Bundling analysis and impact on the I2RS link identifier**

### 2) Applicability Statement I-D Review

There is no progress on auto generation of topology JSON code: [pull request #15](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/pull/15)

The pull request will be closed but in order to reduce the efforts to develop hand-crafted JSON code examples, we will change the assumptions on the type of abstractio provided by each PNC: need to udpate JSON codes as well as Internet-Draft text  

### 3) Open Issues Review

[Open Issue #20](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/issues/20) (Review of OpenConfig model): to be closed
  
[Open Issue #22](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/issues/22) (Add considerations about ODUCn): closed  
  
[Open Issue #23](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/issues/23) (Review TIP and check YANG usage and applicability to NBI discussion): to be closed

[Open Issue #28](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/issues/28) (Multi-layer Modelling with ACTN): closed

[Open issue #37](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/issues/37) (Need to cleanup the GitHub Structure and move Code to GitHub Code tracker): closed

Work on the open issues will continue via correspondance and at the next DT call  
 
### 4) AOB

Next call is planned on September 26, 2018 at 3pm CEST
