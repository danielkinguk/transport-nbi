### 1) Follow-up after IETF 102 meeting

  
DT Applicability Statement I-D presented at CCAMP WG: [notes-ietf-102-ccamp](http://etherpad.tools.ietf.org:9000/p/notes-ietf-102-ccamp?useMonospaceFont=true)  
  
There was some offline interest shown for having the JSON code examples validation tools shared to broader community.  
  
**[Action Point #39](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/issues/39) (Gianmarco): prepare a plan, and share with the DT, for submitting an Internet-Draft to Netmod WG based on the Appendix A of the DT Applicability Statement I-D**  
  
The DT meet face-to-face on July 18, 2018: [2018-07-14-20-IETF102](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/tree/master/Meetings/2018-07-14-20-IETF102)  
  
Based on that discussion, the comments raised during the CCAMP WG can be addressed by adding more clarification statements to the Applicability Statement I-D.  
  
**[Action Point #40](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi/issues/40) (Italo/Daniel): update the Applicability Statement I-D to address the comments discussed during IETF 102**  

### 2) AOB

DT members are invited to continue contributing/discussing via mailing list and github before the next call.
