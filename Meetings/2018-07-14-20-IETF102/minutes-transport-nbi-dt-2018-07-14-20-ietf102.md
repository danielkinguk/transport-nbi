Meeting Notes:
--------------

  

### 1) What is the definition of “Domain”?

We will provide clarification and scope in the document. Find relevant RFC reference. We also need to specify which layers are actually managed within our examples. Our definition of “domain” will be based on our context. I.E., the definition of “Domain” in the context of this document is… based on the following use cases. We will also add text to explain our assumptions for a “customer domain” and “network domain”. Do we use UNI link definition/usage as well?
  
### 2) [Gert’s comment in CCAMP WG](https://etherpad.tools.ietf.org/p/notes-ietf-102-ccamp])

See above. This concern should be addressed with the inclusion of a suitable reference. 

### 3) [Gabriele’s questions in CCAMP WG](https://etherpad.tools.ietf.org/p/notes-ietf-102-ccamp)

The questions are regarding Layer-3 and Layer-0

We are focusing on NEs which are using ODU switching layer, we assume that the link is preconfigured and may be using WDM. We will state this initially in an “Assumptions” section.

### 4) Security Section

Missing a Security section. Use of General Communication Channel (GCC) for in-band communication between network nodes, and discussion on the network controller and its impact on security

### 5) AOB

Planning for next call:
- Tooling for JSON code (Gianmarco) 
- Identifier (Carlo)
